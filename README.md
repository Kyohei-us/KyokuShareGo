# KyokuShareGo Web App

This is a web app for sharing your thoughts on songs you've recently listened to with the internet!

It's developed with [Go](https://github.com/golang/go), [gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin) (web framework), [gorm](https://github.com/go-gorm/gorm) (ORM for db access), [tailwindcss](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss).

## Basic Functions

Anyone can do read access.
For create access, you need to sign up as a user, then login first.

Users can:
- read/create comments on songs.
- read a song to comment on.
- edit user profile.
